# ü§ù Code of Conduct
We are committed to fostering an open and inclusive community. All contributors are expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Please read it to understand the expectations for respectful and collaborative behavior.

# üõ†Ô∏è How Can I Contribute?
We welcome contributions in many forms, including but not limited to:
### **üìÅ Template Contributions**

- **Optimize performance:** Ensure templates are lightweight and follow best practices.

## üß™ Features and Bug Fixes

- **CLI enhancements:** Add new commands or options (e.g., Git initialization, auto-install dependencies, custom template prompts).
- **Bug fixes:** Address issues reported in the issue tracker.
Performance improvements: Optimize CLI performance for faster template generation.

## üìù Documentation

- Improve this CONTRIBUTING.md guide or the main README.md.
- Write detailed usage examples, tutorials, or FAQs.
- Create guides for advanced configurations or integrations.

## üß™ Testing

- Write unit or integration tests to ensure CLI reliability.

- good first issue: Simple tasks to get started.
- help wanted: Tasks where we need extra hands.
Browse the issue tracker to find something that matches your skills and interests.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Development Environment
Follow these steps to set up the OneTech CLI project locally:
<br/>

1. Fork the Repository
- Navigate to https://github.com/NikhilKatkuri/onetech.
- Click the Fork button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. Clone Your Fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/onetech.git
cd onetech
```
3. Install Dependencies
OneTech CLI uses Node.js, so ensure you have Node.js (LTS version recommended) installed.
```bash
npm install 
```

Note: We recommend using pnpm for faster dependency installation, but npm works just as well.

4. Run the CLI Locally
To test the CLI during development:
```bash
npm run test
```

This will run the CLI in development mode, allowing you to test commands locally.
5. Verify Setup
Run the following to ensure the CLI is working:
```bash
npm run test --help
```
You should see the CLI's help menu with available commands.

# üöÄ Submitting Contributions
Follow these steps to submit your contributions via a Pull Request (PR):
<br/>
**1. Create a New Branch** <br/>
Use a descriptive branch name that reflects your changes:
git checkout -b feat/add-vite-shadcn-template
Examples: fix/cli-error-handling, docs/update-readme

**2. Make Your Changes**<br>
Implement your feature, bug fix, or documentation update.
Ensure your changes align with the Code Guidelines.
Test your changes locally to verify they work as expected.

**3. Commit Your Changes**<br>
Use clear, descriptive commit messages following the Conventional Commits format:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new Vite + Shadcn template"
# Examples: "fix: resolve CLI crash on invalid input", "docs: add FAQ section"
```

**4. Push to Your Fork**<br>
```bash
git push origin feat/add-vite-shadcn-template
```
**5. Open a Pull Request**<br>
- Navigate to the OneTech repository.
- Click **New Pull Request** and select your branch.
- Provide a clear PR title and description, referencing any related issues (e.g., Closes #123).
- Submit the PR and wait for feedback from maintainers.

**6. Address Feedback**<br>
- Respond to reviewer comments promptly.
- Make requested changes and push updates to the same branch.
- Ensure all CI checks (e.g., linting, tests) pass.

<br/>
<br/>

# **‚úÖ Code Guidelines**
To maintain consistency and quality, please adhere to the following guidelines:<br/>

## **General**

- Write clean, modular, and maintainable JavaScript or TypeScript code.
- Follow the existing project structure and conventions.
- Use meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.
- Ensure code is compatible with Node.js LTS versions.

## CLI Structure

- Keep template files organized under /templates/template-name.
- Place CLI logic in /src and ensure modularity.
- Update the /bin/index.js entry point only when adding new commands.

## Commit Messages
Use Conventional Commits for clarity:
- feat: New features or templates.
- fix: Bug fixes.
- docs: Documentation updates.
- test: Adding or updating tests.
- chore: Maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency updates).

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for TypeScript in Vite templates"
```
## Code Style

- Run npm run lint to check for code style issues.
- Use ESLint and Prettier configurations from the project (package.json).
- Ensure all code is formatted before committing:

```bash
npm run format
```
## üß™ Testing
- Testing is critical to ensure the CLI works reliably across environments.<br/>
**Running Tests**
Run the test suite (if available):
```bash
npm test
```

## Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for new CLI commands or utilities in /tests.
- Use a testing framework like Jest (if configured in the project).
- Test templates by generating them locally and verifying output:

```bash
npm run test create my-app --base=vite --lang=ts --template=vite-tailwind
```

## Test Guidelines

- Write tests for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, missing dependencies).
- Ensure tests cover both success and failure scenarios.
- Update tests when modifying existing functionality.


# üìù Documentation
Good documentation is essential for an open-source project. Contributions to documentation are highly valued.
## **Updating Documentation**

- Improve *README.md* with clear usage instructions or examples.
- Enhance this *CONTRIBUTING.md* guide with additional details or clarifications.
- Add FAQs or troubleshooting guides in */docs* (if applicable).

# Writing Examples

- Include practical examples in the README.md or a dedicated /examples folder.
- Example format:

### Example: Creating a Vite + Tailwind Project

```bash
npx create-onetech-app my-app --base=vite --lang=ts --template=vite-tailwind
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
This generates a Vite-based project with Tailwind CSS preconfigured.
